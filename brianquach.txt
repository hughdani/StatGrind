My name is Brian Quach, I'm a third year Computer Science student in the Software Engineering Stream Co-op program at UTSC. My background in computer science ranges from languages including Python, Java and Visual Basic. I'm also experienced with Microsoft SQL Server and Business Intelligence solutions including SSIS and SSRS. I have some experience with front end development with HTML, CCS, Bootstrap and Javascript. I am an extremely quick learner, and love to challenge myself with new technologies and projects. I believe that I am an excellent team player that works very well in groups. Through my first hand experience with the Software Development Life Cycle gained throughout my co-op work terms, I am confident that I will be able to provide value to this group as we create something great.In my spare time, I enjoy listening to music, baking, reading and watching movies.
I'm also really good at ring toss :)
