My name is Adam Koza, I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the university of Toronto. Originally from London Ontario. I have acquired development experience working for several organizations. Data migration project lead for Health Canada in Ottawa, moved all natural health product records and documentation into a new CMS using python and automated reporting using VBA/excel macro scripts. Utilised PHP, Shibboleth SSO, and Mysql to build a disaster recovery tool for the University of Western Ontario in London. Provided WordPress web development for the University of Toronto's startup incubator - The Hatchery, and most recently assisted with production database support (Microsoft SQL and Oracle) for Bank of Montreal in Toronto.  

I was an early supporter and investor in Bitcoin. I Developed the first world-wide SMS based wallet and offline transfer application for Bitcoin - BTC2SMS.  

My free time is spent researching new cryptocurrencies and ICO opportunities, trying out new recipes, cheering on our Toronto Blue Jays, snowboarding during the winter, and hanging out with family and friends.
