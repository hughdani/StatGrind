I'm Darius, third year CS SE student. Like many others I started off making simple games and applications to test the waters and explored different branches of CS during my free times. Some of the first things I ever made were simple side-scroller and turn based RPG games with C#, which ultimately lead me to an intern position developing web applications in ASP.NET and C#. They also brought me to make many close friends through team projects along the way. These days I have become interested in exploring open source projects (Linux packages), web applications, mobile applications, and operating systems.
