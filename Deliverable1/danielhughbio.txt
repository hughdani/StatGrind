My name is Daniel Hugh and I am a third-year student in the Specialist Computer Engineering Stream Co-op program at the University of Toronto Scarborough.  I have mainly worked with back-end development (Java, Python, C#) and have some exposure to front-end development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery) and web technologies (ASP.NET). The languages which I am most familiar with is Java, with over 4 years experience. However, I am willing to learn and work with unfamiliar technology. I work well in both individual and team situations. I get along with others and respect their ideas. I believe that amazing things can be created when team members with difference experiences work together as a single unit. I am a resilient person who will work continuously on solving problems and will not feel satisfied until a solution is produced.
