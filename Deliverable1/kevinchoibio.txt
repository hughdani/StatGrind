My name is Kevin Choi, I am a 3rd year student in Computer Science Specialist Co-op Program at University of Toronto Scarborough campus. I have excellent knowledge in programming languages such as Java, C# and Python. I have also completed numerous individual and group projects, which developed effective problem solving skills and my expertise in overcoming challenges encountered in projects. In addition to proficiency in producing codes, I also have a thorough understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle and have experience with creating UML (Unified Modeling Language), SRS (Software Requirement Specification) and basic knowledge on ER (Entity-Relationship) diagrams. I have created and executed numerous tests, which includes unit testing, Black-box and White-box testing that test the functionality of the program, as well as developed and maintained test automations.
