Discussion Items / Actions / Decision

Platform
	- Language: PHP
	- Framework: Laravel, Bootstrap
	- Database: MySQL

Question Sourcing
	- We will try to use the same database of questions as Webwork
	- Adam showed us a local copy of the questions that he pulled onto his server

Personas
	- Plan to combine some pre-existing personas (TA & Prof or TA & Student)
	- Get rid of a few niche personas (ie. Keith)

User Stories
	- Need to prioritize the current list of user stories
	- Need to spell out basic functionality of the web application, missing
	- A lot of the current user stories are fluff 

GitHub
	- 'Master' branch can only be merged with another 'Experimental' branch
	- For each task 'Experimental' will be branched/merged
	- Once 'Experimental' is robust we will merge it to master

Pace
	- Keep pace up with the class, follow Thierry's recipe
	- No one is comfortable with programming at this stage
 
Client
	- User stories are not ready, will need to have a complete version before we make a meeting to get her opinion on features

Plans for Reading Week
	- Next meeting will be Wednesday 2:00, discord
	- Try to brainstorm some changes to personas/user stories beforehand
