Questions for Sohee
    - Question Generating: Client is okay with writing her own questions using LaTeX
    - WolframAlpha API: Sohee is not familiar with WolframAlpha, prefers LaTeX
    - Random Varaibles: Random variables can be generated by giving a range to generate from (ie. generate a number from 1 to 100)
    - Assignment templates: Assignments should be completely unique when generated. they will consist of a set of randomly chosen questions from a pool, each with random variables
	- Likes/Dislikes about Webwork: Likes randomization, Post-assignment stats, student stats. Dislikes UI, significant digits for answer checking (accuracy), generating questions
